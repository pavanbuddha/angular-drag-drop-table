# angular-drag-drop-table
Drag n Drop tables using Angular cdk

The @angular/cdk/drag-drop module provides you with a way to easily and declaratively create drag-and-drop interfaces, with support for free dragging, sorting within a list, transferring items between lists, animations, touch devices, custom drag handles, previews, and placeholders, in addition to horizontal lists and locking along an axis

Here I used this new feature of Angular to re-organise the items between two tables.
